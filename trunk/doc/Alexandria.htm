		<h1>Design Overview</h1>
		<p>Alexandria is a cross-platform application suite for discovering, organizing, viewing, reviewing and adding metadata to digital media.</p>
		<h2>Architecture</h2>
		<p>Alexandria is designed around a dynamic plugin model that minimizes the interdependence of the constituant parts. This allows plugin modules 
		to be designed against a common API and with minimal external dependencies.  Because of this focus on independence between plugin modules it is 
		possible for even core functionality such as the playback engine to be swapped out without (necessarily) impacting the overall functionality of 
		the sytem.  Additionally, plugin modules use a capability model to communicate what features and options they support so it can be made clear to 
		then end user the what the functional differences are between two plugins of the same type.  Fundamental to the design of Alexandria is the 
		client-server model such that an Alexandria client can access media resources both locally and remotely; from ad-hoc distributed providers such 
		as internet radio stations as well as other Alexandria users who can serve their media to others.  In this regard an Alexandria client has the 
		potention to act as both a client and a server.
		</p>		
		<h2>Framework</h2>
		<p>Alexandria is based on version 2.0 of the .NET framework which means that plugin modules can be written in any language which 
		targets version 2.0 of the .NET CLR.  Alexandria can be compiled and run against the Mono and Microsoft .NET runtimes.  Examples of languages 
		that can be used to write Alexandria plugins are as follows:

			<tr class="header"><td rowspan="2">CLR Language</td><td colspan="2">Framework Version</td></tr>
			<tr class="header"><td>Mono</td><td>.NET</td></tr>
			<tr><td>C#</td><td>1.2</td><td>2.0</td></tr>
			<tr><td>VB.NET</td><td>1.2*</td><td>2.0</td></tr>
			<tr><td>IronPython</td><td>1.2</td><td>2.0</td></tr>
			<tr><td>Boo</td><td>1.2</td><td>NA</td></tr>

		* VB.NET is still experimental/incomplete in Mono 1.2		
		<h2>Plugin Types</h2>
		<p>Plugin modules provide all of the functionality in Alexandria.
